UserDefinedTargets
================================================================================
This sample app illustrates how to use the Vuforia UserDefinedTargets feature. 
This app doesnâ€™t require a predefined image target in order to view the 
augmentation.  Instead, the user can define the image that they want to use as a 
target for the augmented 3D teapot.

================================================================================
How to use the sample
================================================================================
1. Point your device at an image such as a poster, magazine, packaging, etc.
2. Follow the instructions for capturing an image
3. See the teapot augmented on top of your image

================================================================================
Tips and tricks
================================================================================
Hold the device parallel to the target when taking a picture.

The white corner marks will turn green when you have selected a target with a 
good amount of detail. 

The sample app can store 5 different targets at once. 

While in the camera view tap the screen once to focus. Tap the screen twice to 
bring up the options menu.
